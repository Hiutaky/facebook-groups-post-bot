<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project have two scripts: __ save_groups.py __ and __ post_groups.py __.

The __ save_groups.py __ script is used to save the groups where you are a member in the data.json, searching them with specific keyword. This script is useful if you want to post in a lot of groups, because you can save the groups in the json file and use it in the __ post_groups.py __ script.

The __ post_groups.py __ script is used to post in spcific groups. In the data.json file you can save the groups where you want to post, and the script will post in all of them.

Warning: *This script is not for spamming groups, is for post in groups where you are a member, and you want to post in a lot of groups at the same time. I am not responsible for the use that you give to this script.*
